In this project I used R to understand how much plastic is being recycled in NYC by doing an exploratory data analysis. In order to understand the problem, I found the NYC Open Data source Recycling Diversion and Capture Rates. The Diversion rate (percentage of total municipal solid waste collected by the Department of Sanitation that is disposed of by recycling) and Capture Rate (percentage of total Paper/Metal/Glass or Plastic in the waste stream that is disposed of by recycling). By looking into the Diversion and Capture Rate I got a better understanding of how much plastic is recycled.  

This Repository is has the final project in a R Markdown and a word document with more details of the steps taken.
